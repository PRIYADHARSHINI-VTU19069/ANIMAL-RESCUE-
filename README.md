# Animal Rescue and Welfare and Health Monitoring System

## Project Overview

The **Animal Rescue and Welfare and Health Monitoring System** is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for the health and well-being of animals. The system integrates a **smart belt** embedded with a chip that monitors and analyzes various health parameters of animals, such as heart rate, body temperature, and behavioral changes. Additionally, the system detects signs of animal abuse by analyzing the heart rate and physical response patterns.

## Key Features

- **Health Monitoring**: The belt continuously tracks the animal's heart rate and body temperature. This data is sent to a central system for analysis to detect any abnormalities or signs of distress.
  
- **Behavioral Analysis**: The system monitors changes in behavior, identifying patterns that may indicate illness, stress, or discomfort. This can help prevent health issues before they become severe.

- **Abuse Detection**: By analyzing heart rate and physiological data, the system can identify signs of abuse or mistreatment. A sudden change in heart rate, for example, may indicate physical harm or stress due to external factors.

- **Real-time Alerts**: The system sends real-time alerts to animal care professionals or rescuers when any critical health changes or abnormal behaviors are detected.

- **Data Analytics**: The collected data is analyzed to create health reports and trends, allowing for better decision-making in the care and rehabilitation of animals.

## Hardware Components

- **Smart Belt**: A wearable belt fitted with sensors to monitor vital signs like heart rate and temperature.
  
- **Chip Sensor**: A small chip embedded in the belt that collects data and transmits it to the system for analysis.

- **Connectivity Module**: Ensures that the data from the smart belt is sent to the central server for processing and analysis.

## Software Components

- **Data Processing Module**: Handles the raw data from the belt, performing analysis on heart rate, temperature, and behavior patterns.
  
- **Alert System**: A system that notifies caregivers in real-time if any abnormalities or abuse are detected.

- **Database**: Stores historical data of the animals, including health records, behavioral changes, and alert logs.
